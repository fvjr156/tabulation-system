# SHS Expo Tabulation System

SY 2324 - STI College Marikina

## Description

- This program is designed to collect votes and evaluations by judges, for the contestants inside a contest (such as a beauty contest, cooking contest, singing contest), then tabulate them in tables/charts.

- Tabulated vote and evaluation data will be used by event organizers to determine the winners of the contest.

- This tabulation system currently uses survey forms as method for data collection, since the designated "judges" are the visitors of the SHS expo, including faculty members, potential investors, and fellow students.

- Scoresheets as per the recommendation of our instructor, will be implemented after the major features of the system are successfully developed

- Tabulation System will be used to evaluate and grade the booths of the strands inside the SHS expo, in order for the event organizers to award and determine the winner based on popular votes

- Tabulation System could also be used to ask the "judges" to grade and evaluate the booth's products (such as the CART's food products), their evaluations of the products will be useful for the strands' research about their products

- Tabulation system is also designed to let the strands/booth organizers to create their own surveys and let the "judges" answer them
